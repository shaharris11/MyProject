      description: "The King of the country of Tempest. Once a human named Satoru Mikami, he was reincarnated into a slime after his death. He is somewhat na√Øve for a king, and peace loving, but still tries his best to rule as a good king. Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for immaturity and naivety. Underneath the surface, Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning, and weighing the pros and cons of their actions, taking the smart move in the long term over more rash and emotional decisions. In betrayal of this composed and calculative demeanor, Rimuru is ruthless when it comes to handling people who have aroused genuine fury inside of them. They'll go as far as acts of brutal torture and murder without so much as batting an eye if it can be gotten away with, and they use more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail when those cards are off the table.",
